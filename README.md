A set of colour schemes for Vim, inspired by Jetbrains' IDEs.

Features
--------

**Familiar Look**
Not only are the colours accurate to the default JetBrains themes, they 
also attempt to emulate the original colour hierarchy. For instance, JSON
keywords are highlighted in the `Constant` colour, not the keyword colour.

**Bring Your Own Colours**
Any of the palette colours can be overidden.
